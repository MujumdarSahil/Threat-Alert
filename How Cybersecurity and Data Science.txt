How Cybersecurity and Data Science are Used in This Project:
Cybersecurity Aspect:

Threat Detection: The project focuses on detecting potential cyber threats like DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), and other attacks based on network traffic data.

Simulated Predictions: Although the model is simulated on the frontend, in real-world scenarios, AI and machine learning models analyze various network traffic parameters (e.g., IP addresses, bytes sent, protocols) to detect abnormal or malicious patterns indicative of cyber threats.

Protecting Networks: By identifying these threats, the system aids in safeguarding networks, ensuring that malicious activities are flagged early for intervention, which is key to network security and incident response.

Data Science Aspect:

Data-Driven Insights: The project uses data science principles to analyze the parameters related to network traffic. Even though it simulates prediction logic, data science techniques like pattern recognition and classification play a crucial role in detecting specific behaviors associated with cyber threats.

Machine Learning: In future implementations, real machine learning algorithms can be used to train on historical data, allowing the model to learn patterns from past cyber-attacks and improve predictions over time.

Analytics and Visualization: Data science also supports the visualization of threat levels, helping cybersecurity professionals understand traffic patterns and take preemptive actions.
